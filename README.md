# **BITS Grade Hub · Unofficial**
**designed & vibe-coded by rk**  
powered by confusion, stubbornness, and a suspicious amount of AI.

## why this exists

because BITS Online students deserve **clarity**,  
not a scavenger hunt across PDFs, LMS pages, and random Telegram screenshots.

at some point every student has thought:

> *“bro what the hell are foundation options, why are electives like Pokémon,  
and why is my CGPA doing parkour?”*

so I built a clean, fast, dead-simple place that explains everything without
making you age 5 years.

## what’s inside

### **1. grade calculator**
turn your quizzes, assignments, and final exam chaos into:
- your current projection  
- your “if I get 50/75/85% in finals” reality check  
- a brutally honest pass/fail preview  
- a target visualizer that tells you the truth you didn’t want

think of it as your academic mirror.  
sometimes it slaps, sometimes it comforts.

---

### **2. what-if simulator**
sliders that show how your GPA changes if you:
- suddenly become studious  
- suddenly lose the will to live  
- or maintain your current “we’ll see” energy

the slider is smooth-ish.  
we’re teaching it manners.

---

### **3. curriculum browser**
no more PDF archaeology.

you get:
- all 6 semesters  
- units, tags, prerequisites  
- foundation choices  
- 4 discipline electives  
- honours tracks  
- degree exit milestones  

all in one place, readable by actual humans.

## big important disclaimer (pls read before suing)

this project is **NOT** official.  
it is **NOT** affiliated with BITS Pilani.  
it does **NOT** replace academic policies, ARD decisions, LMS rules,  
or anything that can get me in trouble.

all final academic decisions belong to BITS Pilani.  
this is just a student-built helper tool.

I built it because the system is confusing  
and someone had to bring some sanity.

## tech stuff (for nerds)
built on:
- react + typescript  
- ai studio + gemini  
- 4 hours with ai studio
- rk’s questionable life choices

## credit
made with love and a lot of trial/error  
by **rk**  

if this helped you, share it.  
if it broke, refresh.  
if it still broke, pretend you didn’t see it.
