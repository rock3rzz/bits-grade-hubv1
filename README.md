# **BITS Grade Hub · Unofficial**
**designed & vibe-coded by rk**  
built out of confusion, stubbornness, and a suspicious amount of AI.

## why this exists

BITS Online students shouldn’t need to dig through scattered PDFs, outdated LMS pages, and random Telegram threads just to understand their own degree.

everyone has had the same moment:

> “what exactly are foundation options, why do electives behave like unlockable levels,  
and why is my CGPA moving like a crypto chart?”

this project exists because the system is confusing and nobody has time for scavenger hunts.

## what’s inside

### 1. grade calculator  
a clean, fast breakdown of your academic reality.

it gives you:
- your current projection  
- scenario outcomes for different final exam scores  
- an early pass/fail signal  
- a target visualizer that tells you the truth politely (most days)

---

### 2. what-if simulator  
interactive sliders that show how your GPA shifts if you:

- suddenly get ambitious  
- suddenly lose all motivation  
- or maintain your current “we’ll see” tempo

the sliders are smoother now, still learning discipline.

---

### 3. curriculum browser  
no more opening PDFs like you’re decoding ancient scriptures.

you get:
- all 6 semesters  
- units, tags, prerequisites  
- foundation options  
- discipline electives  
- honours pathways  
- degree exit milestones  

all in one place, actually readable.
